Description: There are many high quality data sets that are freely
    available for Australia. Unfortunately they can be difficult to obtain
    and analyse.  Here we provide tools to programmatically import and
    explore Australian data sets.  Data can be obtained from the official
    Australian government portal, which contains over 40,000 data sets
    (<https://data.gov.au>).  Additionally, economic data sets can be
    obtained from the Australian Macro Database
    (<http://ozmacrodata.org>).  This project was created during the 2017
    BURGr R UnConference <https://github.com/AU-BURGr/UnConf2017>.
